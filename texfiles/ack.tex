\prefacesection{Acknowledgments}
First of all, I want to thank my family for always supporting me even from far far away.
I feel so lucky to be raised them.
I am very grateful to have Dr.~Hell as my senior-supervisor.
I do not know how to thank him for his supervision, support, help, and patience. 
This thesis would have been is it is today without his dedication.
I do not also know how to thank my dear friends which have been really supportive in my hardest
days away from home.
I also thank my previous supervisor Dr.~Bulatov for his contributions in this work and introducing
the area to me.
