%%% The following code demonstrates the ``other list'' facility. A new
%%% command \otherlist is defined for the List of Programs. Programs
%%% are defined as floating environments of type 3 (1 is used for figures,
%%% 2 for tables) and the information about them is stored in an
%%% auxiliary file with .lop extension. You can use this method to
%%% define several types of ``other lists,'' but in that case you'll
%%% need to add appropriate code to \lists in the csthesis.sty
%%% package.
%%% Note: It's better to move this code into your own mythesis.sty
%%% package. If you do that, you should get rid of the \makeatletter,
%%% \makeatother commands.
