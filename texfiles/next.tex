\chapter{Monotone Graphs}
Give some background on list homomorphism and MinCost homomorphism problems.

Cite major results and give define interval graphs and proper interval graphs. Define similar structures 
on bipartite graphs. Provide a few examples of each.


Remind the theorem about the monotone relations from previous chapter and provide a few examples of
non oriented graph. Argue that they are usually reflexive. Mention the \(WR_2\) as a non-reflexive
example.

\section{Bipartite Graphs}
Extend the results for monotone relations to bipartite graphs. Bring this part from the previous chapter.

Give examples of bipartite graphs with min-ordering that are not monotone.
Potentially if possible show monotone bipartite graphs have min-ordering.

Give examples of monotone bipartite graphs which do not have min-max ordering.
Prove that if a bipartite graph has min-max ordering then it is monotone (trivial).

There is a proof that any bipartite graph containing induced \(C_6\) is not monotone.
Clean up the proof and extend it to all cordless cycles.

\section{Reflexive Graphs}
Provide a similar argument for reflexive graphs. Show that monotone graphs are interval graphs.
Show that proper interval graphs are monotone(trivial). Give example of interval graphs that
are not monotone, also give examples of monotone graphs which are not proper interval graphs.
