Constraint satisfactions is a framework to express combinatorial problems.
\ccsp\ is the problem of finding the number of solutions for a constraint satisfaction problem
instance. In this work, we study complexity of approximately solving the \ccsp\@. We
provide several techniques for approximation preserving reductions
among counting problems. Most of this work focuses on reduction to \cbis,
the problem of finding the number of independent sets in a bipartite graph.

We prove that approximately solving \ccsp(\mrelset) over relations which we call \emph{monotone},
is not harder than \cbis\@. We also prove that approximately
solving \chom(\mH) for reflexive oriented graphs is not easier than \cbis\@.
Finally, we investigate monotone reflexive graphs.
