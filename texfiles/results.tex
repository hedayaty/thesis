\chapter{Results on Complexity of \cbis} \label{chp:results}
%In this chapter, we mention our major results on approximability
%of the problem \ccsp(\mrelset).
In this chapter and the next one, after discussing general results on \ccsp(\mrelset)
over monotone \mrelset, we use \cbis\ as a yardstick to classify some \chom(\mH)
as ``not too hard'' or ``not too easy''\@.
We first show that for monotone relations, there is an
AP-reduction from the problem \ccsp(\mrelset) to the problem \cbis\@.
Then, we show that there is an AP-reduction from the problem \cbis\
to the problem \chom(\mH) if \mH\ is a reflexive oriented graph.

For constraint languages consisting of a binary relation, the problem \ccsp(\mrelset) is
the same as the problem \chom(\mH); hence, we use them interchangeably depending on the on the context.

\section{Monotone Relations}
In this section, we extend the definition of \emph{monotone} constraint languages defined in
\cite{Trichotomy} from Boolean domains to general domains and show that for
any monotone relation \mrelset\ there is an AP-reduction from the problem \ccsp(\mrelset) to
the problem \cbis\@.

\begin{defi} [Distributive Lattice]
A \emph{distributive lattice} \(L=(X,\wedge,\vee)\) is a set \(X\) with a pair of binary operators \(\wedge\)
and \(\vee\) on \(X\) that are 
\begin{itemize}
\item idempotent: \(x \wedge x = x\) and \(x \vee x = x\),
\item commutative: \(x \wedge y = y \wedge x\) and \(x \vee y = y \vee x\),
\item associative: \(x \wedge (y \wedge z) = (x \wedge y) \wedge z\) and 
\(x \vee (y \vee z) = (x \vee y) \vee z\),
\item absorptive: \(x \wedge (x\vee y) = x\) and \(x \vee (x \wedge y) = x\),
\item distributive: \(x \wedge (y \vee z) = (x \wedge y) \vee (x \wedge z)\) and
\(x \vee (y \wedge z) = (x \vee y) \wedge (x \vee z)\)
\end{itemize}
\end{defi}

\begin{defi} [Monotone relation]
Let \mrelset\ be a constraint language over the domain \mD; \mrelset\ is \emph{monotone}
if there exists distributive lattice order \(L=(D,\wedge,\vee)\) such that every relation 
in \mrelset\ is closed under operations \(\vee\) and \(\wedge\)\@.
\end{defi}

Theorem~\ref{thm:monotone} is based on an unpublished manuscript by Hedayaty and Bulatov(2009)\@. 
\begin{theorem} \label{thm:monotone}
Let \mrelset\ be a constraint language over a domain \mD, if 
\mrelset\ is monotone then \ccsp(\mrelset) \maple \cbis\@.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We reduce the \ccsp(\mrelset) from the general domain to Boolean domain. The proof is easy.
Let \mrelset\ be a monotone constraint language with distributive lattice \(L=(D,\wedge,\vee\)\@.  By the Birkhoff's Representation Theorem, every finite distributive lattice
is isomorphic to a lattice ordered Boolean vector space of dimension \(k\)\@.
Denote the isomorphism functions by \(\cube: D \to \setof{0,1}^k\) and 
\(\recube : \setof{0,1}^k\to D\)\@. The definition of the \(\cube\) function
is extended to tuples, as \(\cube(x_1,\dotsc,x_l)=(\cube(x_1),\dotsc,\cube(x_l))\)\@.
The definition of \(\cube\) is further extended to relations as 
\(\cube(R) = \setof{\cube(\varrho) \mid \varrho \in R}\)\@.

Take \(\relset'=\setof{\cube(R)\mid R\in \relset}\)\@. The functions \(\cube\) and
\(\recube\) form a bijection between the solutions for any CSP(\mrelset) instance and the 
corresponding CSP(\(\relset'\)) instance. Hence, there is a parsimonious reduction between 
the problem \ccsp(\mrelset) and the problem \ccsp(\(\relset'\)). Now, we prove that
\(\relset'\) is monotone. For any relation \(R' \in \relset'\) we have
\[\vx \in R \Leftrightarrow \cube(\vx) \in R'\]
We show that for any two tuples \(\vx,\vy\in R'\) we have 
\(\vx \vee \vy, \vx\wedge\vy\in R'\). Namely,
\begin{eqnarray*}
\vx,\vy \in R'  \\
\recube(\vx),\recube(\vy)\in R  \\
\recube(\vx) \vee \recube(\vy) \in R  \\
\cube(\recube(\vx)\wedge\recube(\vy))\in R' \\
\vx \wedge \vy \in R' \\
\end{eqnarray*}
Similarly \(\vx \vee \vy \in R'\)\@.
\(\relset'\) is monotone and by Theorem~\ref{thrm:trichotomy}, we have 
\ccsp(\(\relset'\))\maple\ \cbis\@. Consequently, \ccsp(\mrelset) \maple\ \cbis\@.
\end{proof}

\begin{comment}
The reduction uses Theorem~\ref{thrm:majority} to break arbitrary relation to binary relation.
A function \(m: D^3\to D\) is said to be a \emph{majority function}, if for any \(x,y\in D\) we have
\(m(x,x,y) = m(x,y,x) = m(y, x, x) = x\)\@. We denote the projection of \mR\ on coordinates \(i\) and
 \(j\) by \(R_{1,2}\) and projections of \mR\ on coordinates from \(i\) to \(j\) by \(R_{i-j}\)\@.


\begin{theorem} [Bergman's Double-projection Theorem (Unpublished)]\label{thrm:majority}
Let \mR\ be a relation of arity \mn\ on domain \(D\) and
\(m\) be a majority function on the same domain.
If \mm\ is a polymorphism for \mR, then \mR\ can be expressed by all 
its binary projections as \(R(x_1,\dotsc,x_n) = \bigwedge_{i,j} R_{i,j}(x_i,x_j)\)\@.
\end{theorem}

We provide our own proof for this theorem.

\begin{proof}
It is trivial that \mR\ implies all its binary projection. We  prove that
binary projections of \mR\ implies \mR\@.
We proceed by induction on \(t\) the arity of the relation \mR\@.
For \(t=2\), the statement is trivial. We show that
if the statement is true for \(t=n-1\) it is also true for \(t=n\)\@.
We want to prove \(\bigwedge_{i,j} R_{i,j}(x_i,x_j) \implies R(x_1,\dotsc, x_n)\).
By induction hypothesis \(R_{1-(n-1)}(x_1,\dotsc,x_{n-1})\) and \(R_{2-n}(x_2,\dots,x_n)\)
is true because \(R_{1-(n-1)}\) and \(R_{2-n})\) are closed under \mm\@.
By hypothesis, \(R_{1,n}(x_1,x_n)\) is also true. Since these relations are projection of \mR,
there are \(y_1,\dotsc,y_n \in D\) such that 
\(R(x_1,\dotsc,x_{n-1},y_n)\), \(R(y_1,x_2,\dotsc,x_n)\), and \(R(x_1,y_2,\dotsc,y_{n-1},x_n)\)
are true. Since \mm\ is a polymorphism of \mR, \(R(x_1,\dotsc,x_n)\) is true.
\end{proof}

For every monotone
relation, we can find a majority projection using \(\vee\) and \(\wedge\) operators. One
example would be \(m(x,y,z)=(x \vee y) \wedge (x \vee z) \wedge (y \vee z)\)\@. 
Thus, every instance of the problem \ccsp(\(\relset'\)) can be parsimoniously reduced to
a \ccsp(\\)) instance, where \(\relset''\) is the binary monotone constraint language.
Finally, \ccsp(\(\relset''\)

\section{Bipartite Monotone Graphs}
In this part, we extend the results from the previous section to bipartite
graphs and define monotone bipartite graphs.

\begin{theorem} [Bipartite Orientation] \label{thrm:bior}
Let \mH\ be a bipartite graph and let \(A\) and \(B\) be an arbitrary
bipartitions of \mH\@. For \(H'\) the directed graph obtained from
\mH\ by orienting the edges from \(A\) to \(B\), we have \chom(\mH) \maple \chom(\(H'\)).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let \mG\ be an input graph for the problem \chom(\mH). If \mG\ is not bipartite then 
\(\hom(G,H)=0\). Restrict \mG\ to bipartite graphs also restrict \mG\ to connected graphs
by Lemma~\ref{lem:connected}\@. Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be bipartition of \mG\ and let \(G_1\) 
and \(G_2\) be the graphs obtained from \mG\ by orienting all edges from \(X\) to \(Y\) and
from \(Y\) to \(X\), receptively. We claim that \(\hom(G,H) = \hom(G_1, H') + \hom(G_2, H')\).
Every homomorphism from \mG\ to \mH\ has to either map all the vertices in
\(X\) to \(A\) and all the vertices in \(Y\) to \(B\) or vice-versa. The homomorphisms that
map \(X\) to \(A\) and \(Y\) to \(B\) are exactly the same as homomorphisms from \(G_1\) to
\(H'\) and similarly the homomorphisms that map \(Y\) to \(A\) and \(X\) to \(B\)
are exactly the same as homomorphisms from \(G_2\) to \(H'\)\@. This implies that
\chom(\mH) \maple\ \chom(\(H'\))\@.
\end{proof}

Typically bipartite graphs are not monotone; however, with the latter orientation
we can extend the definition of monotone graphs to bipartite graphs.
we may get monotone graph.

\begin{defi} [Bipartite Monotone Graphs]
Let \(H\) be a bipartite graph and let \(A\) and \(B\) be an arbitrary
bipartitions of \(H\). Let \(H'\) be the directed graph obtained from
\(H\) by orienting the edges from \(A\) to \(B\)\@. The graph \mH\ is said to be
\emph{monotone} if \(H'\) is monotone.
\end{defi}

Note that, the choice for bipartition of \(H\) is not significant for
\(H'\) being monotone or not.

\begin{theorem} [Bipartite Monotone Graphs]
For any bipartite monotone graph \mH, we have \chom(\mH) \maple \cbis\@.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
For any bipartite monotone graph \mH, by Theorem~\ref{thrm:bior} there is a directed monotone 
graph \(H'\) such that \chom(\mH) \maple \chom(\(H'\))\@. By Theorem~\ref{thm:monotone},
\chom(\(H'\)) \maple \cbis\@. Thus, \chom(\mH) \maple \cbis\@.
\end{proof}

\section{Reflexive Oriented Graphs}
An \emph{oriented graph} is a digraph such that if \(uv\) and \(vu\) are edges then \(u=v\)\@.
In this section, we show that for any reflexive oriented graph \mH, we have \cbis \maple \chom(\mH)\@.

\begin{figure}[h]
\center{\input{figs/rba.pdftex}}
\caption{A reflexive oriented graph}
\end{figure}

Let \(\NHab Hab\) be the set of vertices that are both in
out-neighbours of \(a\) and in-neighbours of \(b\).
Note that if \mH\ is reflexive and \((a,b)\in E(H)\),
both \(a\) and \(b\) are in \(\NHab Hab\)\@.
Let \(\Hab\) be the subgraph of \mH\ induced by \(\NHab Hab\).
\emph{Magnitude} of \mH\ represented as \(\magf(H)\) is defined as
\(\max \limits_{(a,b) \in E(H)} \setof{|\NHab Hab|}\)\@.

\begin{figure}[h]
\center{\input{figs/shade2.pdftex}}
\caption{A reflexive oriented graph \ensuremath{H} such that \ensuremath{\magf(H)=2}}
\end{figure}

\begin{lemma} \label{lem:triangle-free}
For any reflexive oriented graph \mH, if \(\magf(H)=2\) then \chom(\mH) \mapge\ \cbis\@.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let \mH\ be a a reflexive oriented graph such that \(\magf(H)=2\)\@.
We reduce the problem \cdsp\ to the problem \chom(\mH)\@.
For a given partial order \(P=(V,\preceq)\), let \(G=(V,E)\) be a reflexive oriented graph
graph in which \(uv\)is an edge if and only if \(a\preceq b\)\@. Take \(G'=(V',E')\) where
\(V'= V \cup \setof{u,v}\) and \(E' = E \cup \setof{(u,v)} \cup
\setof{(u,x),(x,v) \mid x\in V}\)\@.

For any homomorphism \(h: G' \to H\), if \(h(u)=h(v)=s\), then \(h(x)=s\) for all \(x\in V\);
otherwise, \((h(u),h(v))\in E(H)\) and for all \(x\in V\), we have either 
\(h(x)=h(u)\) or \(h(x)=h(v)\); thus,
\(h\) corresponds to a downset in \(P=(V,\preceq)\)\@.

The number of homomorphisms with \(h(u)=h(v)\) is equal to \(|V(H)|\) and
the number of homomorphisms with \(h(u)\neq h(v)\) is equal to \(|E(H)|\) times the 
number of downsets in \(P\), because \(k(H)=2\)\@. Note, we denote by \(\hom(G,H)\) the
number of homomorphisms from \mG\ to \mH\ and by \(\cds(P)\) the number of
downsets in \(P\)\@. Hence,
\[\hom(G',H) = |V(H)| + |E(H)|\cdot \cds(P).\]
In other words
\[\cds(P) = \frac{\hom(G',H) - |V(H)|}{|E(H)|}.\] 
By Lemma~\ref{lem:linear} we have \chom(\mH) \mapge\ \cdsp\@.
\end{proof}

\begin{defi} [Polar Graph]
Let \mH\ be a reflexive oriented graph. We say \mH\ is \emph{polar}
if there are vertices \(a,b\in V(H)\),
such that \((a,x), (x,b) \in E(H)\) for all vertices \(x \in V(H)\) (including \(a\) and \(b\)).
\end{defi}

Note that for a polar graph \mH, we have \(\NHab Hab = V(H)\) and \(\magf(H)=|V(H)|\)\@.

\begin{figure}[h]
\center{\input{figs/polar.pdftex}}
\caption{A polar graph}
\end{figure}

\begin{lemma} \label{lem:k-fixing}
For any reflexive oriented graph \mH\ that \(k(H) > 2\), there is a reflexive oriented graph
\(H'\) such that each connected component of \(H'\) is a
polar graph, \(\magf(H) = \magf(H')\), and
\chom(\mH) \mapge\ \chom(\(H'\)).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Take the graph \(H'\) as union of \(\Hab\) for all \((a,b)\in E(H)\), and
not that \(\magf(H_{a,b})=\magf(H)\)\@. Note also that, each component of \(H'\) is \(\Hab\) for 
some \(a\) and \(b\); thus, each component of \(H'\) is a polar graph.
We show that \chom(\(H'\)) \maple \chom(H)\@.

Let \(G=(V,E)\) be the input graph for the problem \chom(\(H'\)) 
and let \(Y\) be a set of \(t\) fresh vertices
(the value of \(t\) will be determined later). Take graph \(G'=(V',E')\) where
\(V'=V \cup Y \cup \setof{u,v}\) and \(E'=E \cup \setof{(u,v)} \cup
\setof{(u,x),(x,v) \mid x\in V \cup Y}\)\@.

Consider any homomorphism \(h: G'\to H\)\@.
For any \(a,b\in V(H)\) that \(h(u)=a\) and \(h(v)=b\), we have \((a,b)\in E(H)\); also
for any vertex \(x\) in \(V\) or \(Y\), since \((u,x)\) and \((x,v)\) are edges in \(G'\), 
\(x\) has to be mapped to \(\NHab Hab\)\@. Note that any vertex in \(Y\) can be freely mapped
to any vertex in \(\NHab Hab\); however, mapping of the vertices of \(V\) should preserve the edges 
of \mG\@. Thus, we have
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hom(G',H) &=&  
\sum_{(a,b)\in E(H)}\left|\NHab Hab\right|^ t \cdot
\hom(G,\Hab)\\
&=& 
\bigsum{\substack{(a,b)\in E(H) \\
\magf(H_{a,b})=\magf(H)}} 
\magf^t(H) \cdot \hom(G,H_{a,b})+
\bigsum{\substack{(a,b)\in E(H) \\ \magf(H_{a,b}) < \magf(H)}}k^t
(H_{a,b})\cdot \hom(G,H_{a,b})
\end{eqnarray*}

Divide both sides of the formula by \(k^t(H)\)\@. We have
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{\chom(G',H)}{\magf^t(H)} &=& 
\bigsum{\substack{(a,b)\in E(H) \\ \magf(H_{a,b})=\magf(H)}} 
\hom(G,H_{a,b}) + 
\bigsum{\substack{(a,b)\in E(H) \\ \magf(H_{a,b})<\magf(H)}}
\left(\frac{\magf(H_{a,b})}{\magf(H)} \right )^t
\cdot\hom(G,H_{a,b})\\
\frac{\chom(G',H)}{\magf^t(H)} &=& 
\hom(G,H') + \bigsum{\substack{(a,b)\in E(H) \\ \magf(H_{a,b})<\magf(H)}}
\left(\frac{\magf(H_{a,b})}{\magf(H)} \right )^t
\cdot\hom(G,H_{a,b})\\
\end{eqnarray*}
Let \(n=|V|\) and let \(m=|V(H)|\). We have \(\frac{\magf(\Hab)}{\magf(H)} \le \frac{m-1}{m}\),
\(E(H)\le n^2\), and \(\hom(G,H_{a,b}) \le n^m\).
We can simplify the formulas as \((\frac{m-1}{m})^t \approx e^{\frac{-t}{m}}\),
\(n^m = e^{m\log n}\), and \(n^2 = e^{2\log n}\).
For \(t > (m^2+2m) \log n\), the second part of the summation is less the \(1\).
Thus, by Lemma~\ref{lem:linear} \chom(\mH) \mapge \chom(\(H'\)).
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma} \label{lem:onecomp}
Let \mH\ be a reflexive oriented graph such that each connected component of \mH\ is a polar graph.
There is connected component \(H'\) of \mH, such that \chom(\(H'\)) \maple \chom(\mH)\@.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
There are two cases:

First case, all connected components of \mH\ are isomorphic.
Let \(H'\) be a connected component of \mH\ and
\mm\ be the number of connected components of \mH\@.
For any graph \mG\ as input for the problem \chom(\mH), \(\hom(G,H)=\hom^m(G,H')\).
By Lemma~\ref{lem:logarithm}, \chom(H) \mapge \chom(\(H'\))\@.

Second case, there are two connected components of \mH, \(H_1\) and \(H_2\) that are not isomorphic.
By Lov\'{a}sz's Theorem, there is a connected graph \(Z\) such that \(\hom(Z,H_1) \neq \hom(Z,H_2)\)\@.
Let \(Z_1,\dotsc,Z_t\) be \(t\) separate copies of \(Z\), where \(t\) is a large number to be 
determined later.
Take the graph \(G=(V',E')\) where \(V'=V \cup V(Z_1)\cup \dotsb \cup V(Z_t) \cup \setof{u,v} \)
and \(E'=E \cup \setof{(u,v)} \cup \setof{(u,x),(x,v) \mid x \in V \cup  Z_1 \cup \dotsb \cup Z_t} \cup
E(Z_1)\cup \dotsb \cup E(Z_t)\)\@. Take \[q= \max \limits_{(a,b) \in E(H)} \hom(Z,H_{a,b})\] also 
take \[H'=\bigcup_{\substack{(a,b)\in E(H) \\ 
\hom(G,H_{a,b})=q}} H_{a,b}\]

Consider all homomorphisms \(h: G'\to H\)\@.
For any \(a,b\in V(H)\) that \(h(u)=a\) and \(h(v)=b\), we have \((a,b)\in E(H)\)\@.
For any vertex \(x\) in \(V\) or \(Z_i\), since \((u,x)\) and \((x,v)\) are edges in \(G'\), 
\(x\) has to be mapped to \(\NHab Hab\)\@. Thus, we have
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hom(G',H) &=&
\sum_{(a,b)\in E(H)} \hom(G,H_{a,b}) \cdot \hom^t(Z, H_{a,b}) \\
&=&
\bigsum{\substack{(a,b)\in E(H)\\ \hom(Z, H_{a,b}) = q}} \hom(G, H_{a,b}) \cdot q^t + 
\bigsum{\substack{(a,b)\in E(H)\\ \hom(Z, H_{a,b}) < q}} 
\hom(G, H_{a,b}) \cdot \hom^t(Z,H_{a,b})\\
&=&
\hom(G,H') \cdot q^t + \bigsum{\substack{(a,b)\in E(H)\\ \hom(Z, H_{a,b}) < q}} 
\hom(G, H_{a,b}) \cdot \hom^t(Z,H_{a,b}).
\end{eqnarray*}
Divide both sides by \(q^t\), and let \(n=|V|\) and \(m=\magf(H)\)\@. We have
\[
\frac{\hom(G',H)}{q^t} = 
\hom(G,H') + 
\bigsum{\substack{(a,b)\in E(H)\\ \hom(Z, H_{a,b}) < q}} 
\hom(G, H_{a,b}) \cdot \hom^t(Z,H_{a,b}) \cdot (\frac{1}{q})^t.
\]
The second part of right hand side can be bounded as
\begin{eqnarray*}
\bigsum{\substack{(a,b)\in E(H)\\ \hom(Z, H_{a,b}) < q}} 
\hom(G, H_{a,b}) \cdot \hom^t(Z,H_{a,b}) \cdot (\frac{1}{q})^t & \le &
n^2 \cdot n^m \cdot \left(\frac{q-1}{q}\right)^t\\
& \approx & e ^ {2\log n} \cdot e^{m\log n} \cdot e^{-\frac{t}{q}}.\\
\end{eqnarray*}

For \(t > q \cdot (m+2)\log n\), it is less then one; hence, we have
\(hom(G,H')=\frac{\hom(G',H)}{q^t}\)\@. By Lemma~\ref{lem:linear},
we have \chom(\mH) \mapge\ \chom(\(H'\)). 

\(H'\) is a subgraph of \mH, with \(\magf(H')=\magf(H)\) and connected components of \(H'\)
are proper subsets of components of \mH\@. After considering the cases multiple times,
\(H'\) will consist of only a single component.
\end{proof}

Using Lemmas \ref{lem:onecomp} and \ref{lem:k-fixing} we show that we can reduce the 
\(\magf(H)\) function without making the problem easier.

\begin{lemma} \label{lem:k-reduction}
Let \mH\ be a reflexive oriented graph, if \(\magf(H) > 2\), then
there is a reflexive oriented graph \(H'\) such that \(\magf(H') < \magf(H)\)
and \chom(\mH) \mapge\ \chom(\(H'\))\@.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By Lemma~\ref{lem:k-fixing}, there is a reflexive oriented graph \(H_1\) such that
every component of \(H_1\) is a polar graph, \(\magf(H_1)=\magf(H)\), and 
\chom(\(H_1\)) \maple \chom(\mH)\@.

By Lemma~\ref{lem:onecomp}, there is a connected component \(H_2\) of \(H_1\) such that,
\(\magf(H_2)=\magf(H_1)\) and \chom(\(H_2\)) \maple \chom(\(H_1\))\@.

Consider the graph \(H_2\) as relation \mR\ over the domain \mD\@.
\mR\ is a polar relation, so there is an element \(a \in D\) such that for all \(x \in D\)
we have \(R(a, x)\)\@. Let \(S = D \setminus \setof a\)\@. We have
\(R(x,a)\) implies \(x=a\) and for any \(y \in S\), we have \(R(a, y), R(y, y)\)\@.
Thus, by Lemma~\ref{lem:pinning}, \ccsp(\setof{R,S}) \maple \ccsp(\mR)\@.

For \(H'=H_2 - a\), \(\magf(H') < \magf(H)\) and
\[\chom(H') \aple \ccsp(\setof{R,S}) \aple \ccsp(R) \aple \chom(H_2) \aple \chom(H).\]
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
For every non-empty reflexive oriented graph \mH, \chom(\mH) \mapge \cbis\@.
\end{theorem}


\begin{proof}
By contradiction, consider a reflexive oriented graph \mH\ with minimum \(\magf(H)\)
such that the problem \chom(\mH) is not AP-reducible to the problem \cbis\@.
By Lemma~\ref{lem:triangle-free}, \(\magf(H) > 2\)\@. 
By Lemma~\ref{lem:k-reduction}, there exists a reflexive oriented graph \(H'\) such that 
\chom(\(H'\)) \maple \chom(\mH) and \(\magf(H) < \magf(H')\)\@.
This contradicts with \mH\ having the minimum \(\magf(H)\).
\end{proof}
